            <div class="main-content-faq__header">How secure is 1ty.me?</div>
            <div class="main-content-faq__text">
              1ty.me runs only in HTTPS. Meaning any data transferred to or from the server is
              encrypted. All notes are encrypted before being stored on the server and only a
              portion of the key to decrypt is contained in the URL. This URL is not stored on the
              server, so only the link can decrypt the notes. Once the notes are viewed the
              encrypted notes are removed from the system. Pretty secure.
            </div>
            <div class="main-content-faq__header">How are the notes stored before being read?</div>
            <div class="main-content-faq__text">
              The notes are encrypted and put into a database. The URL is hashed so you can not link
              a URL to a note directly.

              Can I retrieve a note after it has been read?
            </div>
            <div class="main-content-faq__text">
              No. It is removed from the system after being displayed once.
            </div>
            <div class="main-content-faq__header">Can you read the notes?</div>
            <div class="main-content-faq__text">
              No. The notes are encrypted using a key that is never stored on the server. Only the
              valid URL can display the notes. Once the notes are viewed the encrypted notes are
              removed from the system and the link can not be viewed again.
            </div>
            <div class="main-content-faq__header">How do I know the note has been read?</div>
            <div class="main-content-faq__text">
              You may choose to enter your email address when creating a note to receive a email
              notifying you the note has been read. You may also enter a reference to keep track of
              the note if sending multiple URL's. The email address is encrypted in the same fashion
              as notes and deleted upon the note being viewed.

              But this is what public/private key (asymmetric) cryptography is for? Why not use PGP?
            </div>
            <div class="main-content-faq__text">
              We agree. If you and your recipient can use asymmetric cryptography (like PGP) then go
              for it. But our clients do not want to deal with that! They do not see the problem of
              sending passwords over regular email. This is easy enough for anyone to use without
              the knowledge of asymmetric cryptography.
